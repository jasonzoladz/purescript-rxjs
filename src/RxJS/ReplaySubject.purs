-- Scheduling

-- | Makes every `next` call run in the new Scheduler.
foreign import observeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Makes subscription happen on a given Scheduler.
foreign import subscribeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- Subscription

-- | Subscribing to an ReplaySubject is like calling a function, providing
-- | `next`, `error` and `completed` effects to which the data will be delivered.
foreign import subscribe :: forall a. Subscriber a -> ReplaySubject a ->  Effect Subscription

foreign import subscribeObservableTo :: forall a. Observable a -> ReplaySubject a -> Effect Subscription

-- Subscribe to an ReplaySubject, supplying only the `next` function.
foreign import subscribeNext
  :: forall a. (a -> Effect Unit)
  -> ReplaySubject a
  -> Effect Subscription


-- Creation Operator

-- | Creates an ReplaySubject that emits the value specify,
-- | and then emits a complete notification.  An alias for `of`.
foreign import just :: forall a. a -> ReplaySubject a

foreign import _empty :: forall a. Unit -> ReplaySubject a

-- ReplaySubject Operators

-- | Send a new value to a ReplaySubject
foreign import next :: forall a. a -> ReplaySubject a -> Effect Unit

-- | An alias for next
send :: forall a. a -> ReplaySubject a -> Effect Unit
send = next

-- | Create an Observable from a ReplaySubject
foreign import asObservable :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> Observable a


-- Transformation Operators

-- | Collects values from the first ReplaySubject into an Array, and emits that array only when
-- | second ReplaySubject emits.
foreign import buffer :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject (Array a)

-- | Collects values from the past as an array, emits that array when
-- | its size (arg1) reaches the specified buffer size, and starts a new buffer.
-- | The new buffer starts with nth (arg2) element of the ReplaySubject counting
-- | from the beginning of the *last* buffer.
foreign import bufferCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (Array a)

-- | Collects values from the past as an array, and emits those arrays
-- | periodically in time.  The first argument is how long to fill the buffer.
-- | The second argument is specifies when to open the next buffer following an
-- | emission.  The third argument is the maximum size of any buffer.
bufferTime :: forall a. Int -> Int -> Int -> (ReplaySubject a) -> (ReplaySubject (Array a))
bufferTime = runFn4 bufferTimeImpl

foreign import bufferTimeImpl :: forall a. Fn4 Int Int Int (ReplaySubject a) (ReplaySubject (Array a))

-- | Collects values from the source ReplaySubject (arg1) as an array. Starts collecting only when
-- | the opening (arg2) ReplaySubject emits, and calls the closingSelector function (arg3) to get an ReplaySubject
-- | that decides when to close the buffer.  Another buffer opens when the
-- | opening ReplaySubject emits its next value.
bufferToggle
  :: forall a b c. (ReplaySubject a)
  -> (ReplaySubject b)
  -> (b -> ReplaySubject c)
  -> (ReplaySubject (Array a))
bufferToggle = runFn3 bufferToggleImpl


foreign import bufferToggleImpl
  :: forall a b c. Fn3 (ReplaySubject a) (ReplaySubject b) (b -> ReplaySubject c) (ReplaySubject (Array a))

-- | Collects values from the past as an array. When it starts collecting values,
-- | it calls a function that returns an ReplaySubject that emits to close the
-- | buffer and restart collecting.
foreign import bufferWhen :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject (Array a)

-- | Equivalent to mergeMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that, unlike mergeMap,
-- | the next bind will not run until the ReplaySubject generated by the projection function (arg2)
-- | completes.  That is, composition is sequential, not concurrent.
-- | Warning: if source values arrive endlessly and faster than their corresponding
-- | inner ReplaySubjects can complete, it will result in memory issues as inner
-- | ReplaySubjects amass in an unbounded buffer waiting for their turn to be subscribed to.
foreign import concatMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b

-- | The type signature explains it best.  Warning: Like `concatMap`, composition is sequential.
foreign import concatMapTo
  :: forall a b c. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> (a -> b -> ReplaySubject c) -> ReplaySubject c

-- | It's Like concatMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that it ignores every new projected
-- | ReplaySubject if the previous projected ReplaySubject has not yet completed.
foreign import exhaustMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b

-- | It's similar to mergeMap, but applies the projection function to every source
-- | value as well as every output value. It's recursive.
foreign import expand :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject a) -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Groups the items emitted by an ReplaySubject (arg2) according to the value
-- | returned by the grouping function (arg1).  Each group becomes its own
-- | ReplaySubject.
foreign import groupBy :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)

foreign import _map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b

-- | Emits the given constant value on the output ReplaySubject every time
-- | the source ReplaySubject emits a value.
foreign import mapTo :: forall a b. b -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b

-- | Maps each value to an ReplaySubject, then flattens all of these ReplaySubjects
-- | using mergeAll.  It's just monadic `bind`.
foreign import mergeMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b

-- | Maps each value of the ReplaySubject (arg1) to the same inner ReplaySubject (arg2),
-- | then flattens the result.
foreign import mergeMapTo :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject b

-- | Puts the current value and previous value together as an array, and emits that.
foreign import pairwise :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (Array a)

-- | Given a predicate function (arg1), and an ReplaySubject (arg2), it outputs a
-- | two element array of partitioned values
-- | (i.e., [ ReplaySubject valuesThatPassPredicate, ReplaySubject valuesThatFailPredicate ]).
foreign import partition :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> ReplaySubject a -> Array (ReplaySubject a)

-- | Given an accumulator function (arg1), an initial value (arg2), and
-- | a source ReplaySubject (arg3), it returns an ReplaySubject that emits the current
-- | accumlation whenever the source emits a value.
foreign import scan :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b

-- | Projects each source value to an ReplaySubject which is merged in the output
-- | ReplaySubject, emitting values only from the most recently projected ReplaySubject.

-- | It's like switchMap, but maps each value to the same inner ReplaySubject.
foreign import switchMapTo :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject b

-- | It's like buffer, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array.
foreign import window :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)

-- | It's like bufferCount, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array.
foreign import windowCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)

-- | It's like bufferTime, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array,
-- | and it doesn't take a maximum size parameter.  arg1 is how long to
-- | buffer items into a new ReplaySubject, arg2 is the when the next buffer should begin,
-- | and arg3 is the source ReplaySubject.
foreign import windowTime :: forall a. Int -> Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)

-- | It's like bufferToggle, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array.
windowToggle
  :: forall a b c. (ReplaySubject a)
  -> (ReplaySubject b)
  -> (b -> ReplaySubject c)
  -> (ReplaySubject (Array a))
windowToggle = runFn3 windowToggleImpl

foreign import windowToggleImpl
  :: forall a b c. Fn3 (ReplaySubject a) (ReplaySubject b) (b -> ReplaySubject c) (ReplaySubject (Array a))

-- | It's like bufferWhen, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array.
foreign import windowWhen :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)

-- | It's like auditTime, but the silencing duration is determined by a second ReplaySubject.
foreign import audit :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Ignores source values for duration milliseconds,
-- | then emits the most recent value from the source ReplaySubject, then repeats this process.
foreign import auditTime :: forall a. Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | It's like debounceTime, but the time span of emission silence is determined
-- | by a second ReplaySubject.  Allows for a variable debounce rate.
foreign import debounce :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject Int) -> ReplaySubject a

-- | It's like delay, but passes only the most recent value from each burst of emissions.

-- | Returns an ReplaySubject that skips n items emitted by an ReplaySubject.
foreign import skip :: forall a. Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Returns an ReplaySubject that skips items emitted by the source ReplaySubject until a second ReplaySubject emits an item.
foreign import skipUntil :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Returns an ReplaySubject that skips all items emitted
-- | by the source ReplaySubject as long as a specified condition holds true,
-- | but emits all further source items as soon as the condition becomes false.
foreign import skipWhile :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Emits only the first n values emitted by the source ReplaySubject.
foreign import take :: forall a. Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Lets values pass until a second ReplaySubject emits something. Then, it completes.
foreign import takeUntil :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject a

-- | Emits values emitted by the source ReplaySubject so long as each value satisfies
-- | the given predicate, and then completes as soon as this predicate is not satisfied.
foreign import takeWhile :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- | It's like throttleTime, but the silencing duration is determined by a second ReplaySubject.
foreign import throttle :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject a

-- | for duration milliseconds, then repeats this process.
foreign import throttleTime :: forall a. Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a

-- Error Handling Operators
