## Module RxJS.ReplaySubject

#### `ReplaySubject`

``` purescript
data ReplaySubject :: * -> *
```

Please see [RxJS Version 5.* documentation](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) for
additional details on proper usage of the library.

##### Instances
``` purescript
Functor ReplaySubject
Apply ReplaySubject
Applicative ReplaySubject
Bind ReplaySubject
Monad ReplaySubject
Semigroup (ReplaySubject a)
Alt ReplaySubject
Plus ReplaySubject
Alternative ReplaySubject
MonadZero ReplaySubject
MonadPlus ReplaySubject
```

#### `observeOn`

``` purescript
observeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a
```

Takes a Scheduler and returns a new ReplaySubject that uses that Scheduler.
It will make every `next` call run in the new scheduler.

#### `subscribeOn`

``` purescript
subscribeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a
```

Forces the subscription and unsubscription

#### `subscribe`

``` purescript
subscribe :: forall a e. Subscriber a -> ReplaySubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

Subscribing to an ReplaySubject is like calling a function, providing
`next`, `error` and `completed` effects to which the data will be delivered.

#### `subscribeNext`

``` purescript
subscribeNext :: forall a e. (a -> Eff e Unit) -> ReplaySubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

#### `just`

``` purescript
just :: forall a. a -> ReplaySubject a
```

Creates an ReplaySubject that emits the value specify,
and then emits a complete notification.  An alias for `of`.

#### `next`

``` purescript
next :: forall a e. a -> ReplaySubject a -> Eff e Unit
```

Send a new value to a ReplaySubject

#### `send`

``` purescript
send :: forall a e. a -> ReplaySubject a -> Eff e Unit
```

An alias for next

#### `asObservable`

``` purescript
asObservable :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> Observable a
```

Create an Observable from a ReplaySubject

#### `buffer`

``` purescript
buffer :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the first ReplaySubject into an Array, and emits that array only when
second ReplaySubject emits.

#### `bufferCount`

``` purescript
bufferCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array, emits that array when
its size (arg1) reaches the specified buffer size, and starts a new buffer.
The new buffer starts with nth (arg2) element of the ReplaySubject counting
from the beginning of the *last* buffer.

#### `bufferToggle`

``` purescript
bufferToggle :: forall a b c. (ReplaySubject a) -> (ReplaySubject b) -> (b -> ReplaySubject c) -> (ReplaySubject (Array a))
```

Collects values from the source ReplaySubject (arg1) as an array. Starts collecting only when
the opening (arg2) ReplaySubject emits, and calls the closingSelector function (arg3) to get an ReplaySubject
that decides when to close the buffer.  Another buffer opens when the
opening ReplaySubject emits its next value.

#### `bufferWhen`

``` purescript
bufferWhen :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array. When it starts collecting values,
it calls a function that returns an ReplaySubject that emits to close the
buffer and restart collecting.

#### `concatMap`

``` purescript
concatMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b
```

Equivalent to mergeMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that, unlike mergeMap,
the next bind will not run until the ReplaySubject generated by the projection function (arg2)
completes.  That is, composition is sequential, not concurrent.
Warning: if source values arrive endlessly and faster than their corresponding
inner ReplaySubjects can complete, it will result in memory issues as inner
ReplaySubjects amass in an unbounded buffer waiting for their turn to be subscribed to.

#### `concatMapTo`

``` purescript
concatMapTo :: forall a b c. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> (a -> b -> ReplaySubject c) -> ReplaySubject c
```

The type signature explains it best.  Warning: Like `concatMap`, composition is sequential.

#### `exhaustMap`

``` purescript
exhaustMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b
```

It's Like concatMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that it ignores every new projected
ReplaySubject if the previous projected ReplaySubject has not yet completed.

#### `expand`

``` purescript
expand :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject a) -> ReplaySubject a
```

It's similar to mergeMap, but applies the projection function to every source
value as well as every output value. It's recursive.

#### `groupBy`

``` purescript
groupBy :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)
```

Groups the items emitted by an ReplaySubject (arg2) according to the value
returned by the grouping function (arg1).  Each group becomes its own
ReplaySubject.

#### `mapTo`

``` purescript
mapTo :: forall a b. b -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b
```

Emits the given constant value on the output ReplaySubject every time
the source ReplaySubject emits a value.

#### `mergeMapTo`

``` purescript
mergeMapTo :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject b
```

Maps each value of the ReplaySubject (arg1) to the same inner ReplaySubject (arg2),
then flattens the result.

#### `pairwise`

``` purescript
pairwise :: forall a. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (Array a)
```

Puts the current value and previous value together as an array, and emits that.

#### `partition`

``` purescript
partition :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> ReplaySubject a -> Array (ReplaySubject a)
```

Given a predicate function (arg1), and an ReplaySubject (arg2), it outputs a
two element array of partitioned values
(i.e., [ ReplaySubject valuesThatPassPredicate, ReplaySubject valuesThatFailPredicate ]).

#### `scan`

``` purescript
scan :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b
```

Given an accumulator function (arg1), an initial value (arg2), and
a source ReplaySubject (arg3), it returns an ReplaySubject that emits the current
accumlation whenever the source emits a value.

#### `switchMap`

``` purescript
switchMap :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> (a -> ReplaySubject b) -> ReplaySubject b
```

Projects each source value to an ReplaySubject which is merged in the output
ReplaySubject, emitting values only from the most recently projected ReplaySubject.

#### `switchMapTo`

``` purescript
switchMapTo :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject b
```

#### `window`

``` purescript
window :: forall a b. ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject b -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)
```

It's like buffer, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array.

#### `windowTime`

``` purescript
windowTime :: forall a. Int -> Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject (ReplaySubject a)
```

It's like bufferTime, but emits a nested ReplaySubject instead of an array,
and it doesn't take a maximum size parameter.  arg1 is how long to
buffer items into a new ReplaySubject, arg2 is the when the next buffer should begin,
and arg3 is the source ReplaySubject.

#### `windowToggle`

``` purescript
windowToggle :: forall a b c. (ReplaySubject a) -> (ReplaySubject b) -> (b -> ReplaySubject c) -> (ReplaySubject (Array a))
```

#### `audit`

``` purescript

sampleTime :: forall a. Int -> ReplaySubject a -> ReplaySubject a
```

Periodically looks at the source ReplaySubject and emits whichever
value it has most recently emitted since the previous sampling, unless the source has not emitted anything since the previous sampling.

the given predicate, and then completes as soon as this predicate is not satisfied.

#### `throttle`

determine the value to be emitted on the output ReplaySubject.

#### `zip`

``` purescript
zip :: forall a. Array (ReplaySubject a) -> ReplaySubject (Array a)
```

Waits for each ReplaySubject to emit a value. Once this occurs, all values
with the corresponding index will be emitted. This will continue until at
least one inner ReplaySubject completes.
