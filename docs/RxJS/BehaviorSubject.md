## Module RxJS.BehaviorSubject

#### `BehaviorSubject`

``` purescript
data BehaviorSubject :: Type -> Type
```

Please see [RxJS Version 5.* documentation](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) for
additional details on proper usage of the library.

##### Instances
``` purescript
Functor BehaviorSubject
Apply BehaviorSubject
Applicative BehaviorSubject
Bind BehaviorSubject
Monad BehaviorSubject
Semigroup (BehaviorSubject a)
Alt BehaviorSubject
```

#### `observeOn`

``` purescript
observeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

Makes every `next` call run in the new Scheduler.

#### `subscribeOn`

``` purescript
subscribeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

Makes subscription happen on a given Scheduler.

#### `subscribe`

``` purescript
subscribe :: forall a e. Subscriber a -> BehaviorSubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

Subscribing to an BehaviorSubject is like calling a function, providing
`next`, `error` and `completed` effects to which the data will be delivered.

#### `subscribeNext`

``` purescript
subscribeNext :: forall a e. (a -> Eff e Unit) -> BehaviorSubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

#### `just`

``` purescript
just :: forall a. a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

Creates an BehaviorSubject that emits the value specify,
and then emits a complete notification.  An alias for `of`.

#### `next`

``` purescript
next :: forall a e. a -> BehaviorSubject a -> Eff e Unit
```

Send a new value to a BehaviorSubject

#### `send`

``` purescript
send :: forall a e. a -> BehaviorSubject a -> Eff e Unit
```

An alias for next

#### `asObservable`

``` purescript
asObservable :: forall a. BehaviorSubject a -> Observable a
```

Create an Observable from a BehaviorSubject

#### `getValue`

``` purescript
getValue :: forall a e. BehaviorSubject a -> Eff e a
```

Obtain the current value of a BehaviorSubject

#### `buffer`

``` purescript
buffer :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the first BehaviorSubject into an Array, and emits that array only when
second BehaviorSubject emits.

#### `bufferCount`

``` purescript
bufferCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array, emits that array when
its size (arg1) reaches the specified buffer size, and starts a new buffer.
The new buffer starts with nth (arg2) element of the BehaviorSubject counting
from the beginning of the *last* buffer.

#### `bufferToggle`

``` purescript
bufferToggle :: forall a b c. (BehaviorSubject a) -> (BehaviorSubject b) -> (b -> BehaviorSubject c) -> (BehaviorSubject (Array a))
```

Collects values from the source BehaviorSubject (arg1) as an array. Starts collecting only when
the opening (arg2) BehaviorSubject emits, and calls the closingSelector function (arg3) to get an BehaviorSubject
that decides when to close the buffer.  Another buffer opens when the
opening BehaviorSubject emits its next value.

#### `bufferWhen`

``` purescript
bufferWhen :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject b) -> BehaviorSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array. When it starts collecting values,
it calls a function that returns an BehaviorSubject that emits to close the
buffer and restart collecting.

#### `concatMap`

``` purescript
concatMap :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject b) -> BehaviorSubject b
```

Equivalent to mergeMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that, unlike mergeMap,
the next bind will not run until the BehaviorSubject generated by the projection function (arg2)
completes.  That is, composition is sequential, not concurrent.
Warning: if source values arrive endlessly and faster than their corresponding
inner BehaviorSubjects can complete, it will result in memory issues as inner
BehaviorSubjects amass in an unbounded buffer waiting for their turn to be subscribed to.

#### `concatMapTo`

``` purescript
concatMapTo :: forall a b c. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> (a -> b -> BehaviorSubject c) -> BehaviorSubject c
```

The type signature explains it best.  Warning: Like `concatMap`, composition is sequential.

#### `exhaustMap`

``` purescript
exhaustMap :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject b) -> BehaviorSubject b
```

It's Like concatMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that it ignores every new projected
BehaviorSubject if the previous projected BehaviorSubject has not yet completed.

#### `expand`

``` purescript
expand :: forall a. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject a) -> BehaviorSubject a
```

It's similar to mergeMap, but applies the projection function to every source
value as well as every output value. It's recursive.

#### `groupBy`

``` purescript
groupBy :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject (BehaviorSubject a)
```

Groups the items emitted by an BehaviorSubject (arg2) according to the value
returned by the grouping function (arg1).  Each group becomes its own
BehaviorSubject.

#### `mapTo`

``` purescript
mapTo :: forall a b. b -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b
```

Emits the given constant value on the output BehaviorSubject every time
the source BehaviorSubject emits a value.

#### `mergeMapTo`

``` purescript
mergeMapTo :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject b
```

Maps each value of the BehaviorSubject (arg1) to the same inner BehaviorSubject (arg2),
then flattens the result.

#### `pairwise`

``` purescript
pairwise :: forall a. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject (Array a)
```

Puts the current value and previous value together as an array, and emits that.

#### `partition`

``` purescript
partition :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> BehaviorSubject a -> Array (BehaviorSubject a)
```

Given a predicate function (arg1), and an BehaviorSubject (arg2), it outputs a
two element array of partitioned values
(i.e., [ BehaviorSubject valuesThatPassPredicate, BehaviorSubject valuesThatFailPredicate ]).

#### `scan`

``` purescript
scan :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b
```

Given an accumulator function (arg1), an initial value (arg2), and
a source BehaviorSubject (arg3), it returns an BehaviorSubject that emits the current
accumlation whenever the source emits a value.

#### `switchMap`

``` purescript
switchMap :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject b) -> BehaviorSubject b
```

Projects each source value to an BehaviorSubject which is merged in the output
BehaviorSubject, emitting values only from the most recently projected BehaviorSubject.

#### `switchMapTo`

``` purescript
switchMapTo :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject b
```

It's like switchMap, but maps each value to the same inner BehaviorSubject.

#### `window`

``` purescript
window :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject (BehaviorSubject a)
```

It's like buffer, but emits a nested BehaviorSubject instead of an array.

#### `windowCount`

``` purescript
windowCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject (BehaviorSubject a)
```

It's like bufferCount, but emits a nested BehaviorSubject instead of an array.

#### `windowTime`

``` purescript
windowTime :: forall a. Int -> Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject (BehaviorSubject a)
```

It's like bufferTime, but emits a nested BehaviorSubject instead of an array,
and it doesn't take a maximum size parameter.  arg1 is how long to
buffer items into a new BehaviorSubject, arg2 is the when the next buffer should begin,
and arg3 is the source BehaviorSubject.

#### `windowToggle`

``` purescript
windowToggle :: forall a b c. (BehaviorSubject a) -> (BehaviorSubject b) -> (b -> BehaviorSubject c) -> (BehaviorSubject (Array a))
```

It's like bufferToggle, but emits a nested BehaviorSubject instead of an array.

#### `windowWhen`

``` purescript
windowWhen :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject (BehaviorSubject a)
```

It's like bufferWhen, but emits a nested BehaviorSubject instead of an array.

#### `audit`

``` purescript
audit :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> (a -> BehaviorSubject b) -> BehaviorSubject a
```

It's like auditTime, but the silencing duration is determined by a second BehaviorSubject.

#### `auditTime`

``` purescript
auditTime :: forall a. Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

It's like debounceTime, but the time span of emission silence is determined
by a second BehaviorSubject.  Allows for a variable debounce rate.

#### `debounceTime`

``` purescript
debounceTime :: forall a. Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

It's like delay, but passes only the most recent value from each burst of emissions.

``` purescript
skip :: forall a. Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

Returns an BehaviorSubject that skips n items emitted by an BehaviorSubject.

#### `skipUntil`

``` purescript
skipUntil :: forall a b. BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject b -> BehaviorSubject a
```

Returns an BehaviorSubject that skips items emitted by the source BehaviorSubject until a second BehaviorSubject emits an item.

#### `skipWhile`

``` purescript
skipWhile :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
```

by the source BehaviorSubject as long as a specified condition holds true,
but emits all further source items as soon as the condition becomes false.

determine the value to be emitted on the output BehaviorSubject.

#### `zip`

``` purescript
zip :: forall a. Array (BehaviorSubject a) -> BehaviorSubject (Array a)
```

with the corresponding index will be emitted. This will continue until at
least one inner BehaviorSubject completes.

```

#### `retry`

``` purescript
retry :: forall a. Int -> BehaviorSubject a -> BehaviorSubject a
